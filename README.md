# Weekend COde Challenge ( STUDENT GRADE GENERATOR)

## Description

This a code that prompts a user to input student marks between 0 and 100 and then ouputs the correct grade:
A > 79,
B - 60 to 79,
C -  59 to 49,
D - 40 to 49,
E - less 40.

And if an input isn't in the range of the range between 0 and 100, it gives out an error message.
